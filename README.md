web link: https://agustinhds.github.io/home/

This is just a webpage that introduces me showing my capabilities. For now it's only a frontend work since github pages doesn't allow me to
upload node files. So i will be working in the backend for this page with node before the deploy using other host

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known issues/changes to make: 

- When the web loads for first time, features section shows top and right buttons, it should onle show one of them acording to the display screen. (this only happen with github pages deploy)

- Pending to fix the google recaptcha service

- Implement redirect 301 system

- Use global variable to hide the key on head html

- Validate the form is completed before sending, do this via server-side with node so the user can't edit the front-end to bypass this

- Show the user 3rd party cookies banner and a link to its service's information (google recapcha)
